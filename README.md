# Data Structures

> A study / experiments in javascript data structures.

## Currently Implemented
* Stack
* Queue
* (linked) List
* Binary Search Tree

Trying to implement them kinda functional-like and stuff. You know, for learnin'.

## Todo 

* [ ] generalized tree
* [ ] balanced binary search tree
* [ ] directed graph
* [ ] binary decision diagram
* [ ] priority queue
* [ ] sets (maybe to js specification)
* [ ] maps (maybe to js specification)
* [ ] implement standard js array function in all data structures
  * [ ] `each` / `forEach`
  * [ ] `map`
  * [ ] `reduce`
  * [ ] `includes`
  * [ ] `find`
  * [ ] `some`
  * [ ] `every`
* [x] move tests into own directory (separate so implementation can be blanked for TDD exercises)
* [ ] cleanup tests
* [ ] READMEs for each data structure
